    "dream": "001 Nightmare in Cambodia. In the dream we are being overrun by sappers who have got past the Night Defensive Perimeter trips and claymores and now crawl forward. I wake up and see a boot tread close to my face. I slowly withdraw my .45 from its holster, pull the hammer back, then aim it at the boot. Just then the cloud-obscured moon comes out and I realize the boot is American and that it is Jerry Bieck's foot. In the pitch stillness I point the .45 straight up in the air. Pinching the hammer tightly I pull the trigger and settle the hammer back in place. I re-holster the pistol and go back to sleep. The next day, after a very difficult march, all the men are overjoyed to be out of Cambodia. I tell no one what almost happened.",

Then I hear the faint echo of the tubes popping. There is an underground bunker; most of us run for the school bus. The mortars are dropping close by, within twenty yards. The fear of realizing death is pacing through my mind. We are all crowded in, scared of a hit. I shield my face with two paperback books. All at once there is a sharp explosion. I am hit, though I scream for only a moment. It is such a helpless feeling. The concussion has shattered the teeth in my mouth and I am going into shock. The dream ends here.",

I go into a bunker and search for my aid bag (claymore) full of 4x7 'bandages. There are none around. I decide to make a search before it is too late. In the dream, I am in a house; all of a sudden mortars begin to drop, close and very loud, and profusely, I remember feeling guilty, the house can withstand practically anything, but I am still terrified. The mortars drop endlessly. When it is all over, I run out. My entire platoon, fifteen men, are all dead. They have been collected and sit in a grotesque formation of the dead.

I address myself to him. He brings up the subject of security and somehow mentions the name of Crazy Frank (used to play with the dead bodies). Suddenly everyone drops, we wait expecting the inevitable machine gun chatter etc., but it is only a false alarm. There are many soldiers spread about in not typical fashion, it appears more like a WWII beach scene than one of.an LZ in Vietnam. A colored soldier rises up and makes an unclear remark. Apparently someone inadvertently set off a chain reaction, all of us obeying the instinct acquired from contact. The commander and I resume talk, we parley for a few more minutes; this time there is no mistake. I hear the sounds of mortars popping from tubes. I look at the commander and say, \"Mortars , run for the bunkers.\" A mad rush for cover follows. In my mind I am counting off 8 seconds even as I am running; this is how much time I anticipate we have. There seems to be an air of complete disregard for everyone but one's self. The commander pulls and tries to get past me; I myself have completely forgotten the girl. The bunker seems familiar, as from another dream. It is too large to be representative of the ones I sought refuge in while in Nam. When I am just inside, mortars begin to drop, I make for a sturdy wall; the sounds, of explosions seem to be coming right over us. I seem to sense that this bunker is more like the basement of a large house, and that the mortars are hitting the building structure above us. The explosions have become deafening. In the last moments of the dream\" I am near an opening, I vaguely see the outside ground, for I am lower and must look up. A terrific whining descends over head; a shell is going to drop very near to us. The blast takes place right outside the opening. I am knocked a few feet by the concussion, but not seriously injured. Very close, a machine gun opens up; it is a light 30 cal. We are under a ground attack. I wake up, bathed in the sweat of nocturnal madness.",

The enemy is undoubtedly oriental, and it is at this point that I detach myself from my own person and either become another, or simply phase out and watch what follows, experiencing the drama vicariously, twofold it would seem, as this is all imagined. The enemy attacks and I become acutely aware of the feeling of being shot in the head. I am behind a wall of some kind, the danger of being hit is very great. In a fury I grab a silver object which seems to resemble an rpg, and hurl it towards the foes. It explodes and immediately the entire area is shrouded in flames, even I (or the person I am watching) is/am enveloped. This is how the dream ends.

    "dream": "007 We are on patrol somewhere in Nam. It is not my old unit but the feelings are the same. We are, the infantry lurking in the jungle. As usual we are spread apart, perhaps 4 to 5 meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see 25\u00b7 to 30 meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh. I anticipate an ambush; things are going too easily. Beyond the stillness of our own guarded movements I sense another. With the first starting shots I drop instinctively to the ground. These are not the familiar popping sounds of the AK, though nonetheless I have anticipated correctly, we are in contact. Those up front fire back, immediately killing two. Then from my position I see two or three heads begin to rise. I yell to the others, at the same time pointing the muzzle of my 16 in the enemy's direction and attempting to fire. The gun jams. Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our 105s or 155s. The number 106 flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back. There is no pain, but I realize this to be a death wound. The last moments of the dream are obscured by the dust clouds.",

He has been wounded in the arm. We gather about and form a defensive perimeter. A machine gun team of dinks stalks right up to us. It seems everyone is too scared to fire. I open up with three short bursts and literally rip the dink gunner in half. A while later, a single dink walks up to us, unmolested. I sense that no one is going to fire and spatter him wickedly with my M-16. It is a good feeling, though I am worried about ammo. We retreat to a large building and cluster fuck within. It seems almost like the room I am living in now. Several of us flop onto the bed and crash. I recall thinking about pulling guard twice a night. It is a wonder that we get enough sleep. I am tempted to doze off but the fear of dinks breaking in prompts me to stay awake. Someone has the side door covered.

Oddly, at first no one dives to the ground. Instead, we look to see what has happened. Capt. Hyslop seems to be standing over a dead dink. Then hell breaks lose. The bamboo surroundings become a barren hilly expanse with dinks about us. They have some sort of modern building on a ledge 100 meters to my right. Way off I see a dink machine gunner beading on us. I open up on him. Then another dink MG appears, closer. I, too, have a machine gun, we will duel with bullets. Who will kill the other first? A dink on the ledge by the building hurls a grenade at me. I am lucky. It is a bit short of its target. I hug the earth and cannot recall being hurt. Next, the dink gunner rolls a base ball grenade towards me. I consider my chances against the time delay, grab it and hurl it a mighty length. It explodes harmlessly in the air. The duel renews. His bullets churn up staccato patterns of dust in front of me. I fire one long burst and catch him with one shot in the chest. He is dead. AK's blossom everywhere. It is like June 16, 1970. I fear running out of ammo. In the dream I am with Larry Roy. We are by a conex filled with ammo. We deliberate what to do. The dream becomes unclear after this.",

I am lying on the counter in a prone position; the atmosphere is one of war. Sandbags and timber abound. The sky is eerily overcast. Bombs begin to fall. Not the mortars of past dreams but rather some kind of heavy artillery. A sharp thunder follows the initial detonation, as if there were some sort of dual explosive, or perhaps a new barrage tactic. I throw myself over and fall to the ground. Cowering under the counter I wait for the inevitable. Within seconds a shell crashes down upon the spot I had occupied and not too hastily vacated. Debris flies; dirt clods and splinters of broken wood shower down. I recall the thought of being randomly lucky. The dream becomes unclear at this point.",

Is none other than the young doctor from LZ Green who did not know how to handle his own rank. We meddle about in a huge canvas tent. I think about digging a fox hole but there are no shovels. Night comes. All of a sudden there is a metallic burst of illumination flares. The sky lights up and we are showered by the magnesium brightness. For the first few moments no one knows what is going on. Who has called for the lume? Then, through the thin canvas I see two figures run past about 40 yards off. So, it is a ground attack. But I say nothing. Moments later the AK's open up. In the dream there are several old house where the gooks have holed up. My old platoon and I converge on it. With my M-16 roaring I cut down several dinks. I am overwhelmed by the sight of two individuals fighting with the enemy. Of all people, there is Wilson, our old RTO. I begin to fire, but my M-16 is sluggish; the bullets dumbly chug out. Wilson is followed by Juba, my friend from down the street, a high school buddy (who now I go to bars with every now and then). Juba has a long .45. His long drilling shots come after Wilson sprays me with a burst that catches me flush across the body. Again, though I am obviously hit, nothing happens. The fire fight ends. We go back to the tent. I see bullet holes in my ankles. The Captain asks me if there is anything I want. I think of telling him, \"Yes! A Medivac,\" but I say only that we should dig fox holes. The next day I scrounge for ammo. There is little or none to be found, though I steal two grenades. I meet Roop and Melhop. During the fire fight, I use grenades but they prove ineffective. Even though I hold them for two or three seconds after the handle flies off (and they hiss like smoke grenades) they are thrown too hard and bounce away, and oddly, explode in a mere crackle of sparks, the way smoke does when it first ignites. Steve Shack (a fellow from sleep away camp) and I go to the other side of the base. There is a small VN compound. Shack throws a grenade into a little wooden school house filled with children. It blows up and there are the horrific screams of the wounded. We walk down a trail. I am telling him how stupid he is for making this mess, surely there will be another attack tonight. Children come shrieking out and run after us. I turn and beckon to them. \"Come with me, come to me.\" A jeep pulls up and takes on the casualties.",

I have no doubt about what I want to do, but I\u2019m insecure about the way he lives \u2013 how he lives \u2013 and if more contact with me will give him problems in some way because he\u2019s this meditation instructor. He doesn\u2019t worry at all. He\u2019s very relaxed and he\u2019s having his hand on my back and it\u2019s a very close contact we have.

There\u2019s a very easy going relaxed atmosphere and everybody has plenty of time. Suddenly we see a very big mulatto girl \u2013 very brown, sensual soft and powerful. And she comes flying. She flies very, very fast. And some small birds and big birds, too, are following after her and sort of sniff to her genitals in a way like flies can do if you lie there without clothes. She\u2019s sort of just whisking them away with her hand once in a while. And then she\u2019s flying as if she was just lying on her stomach and I say to the \u2013 I think it\u2019s the man in this older couple - that I have heard that you can fly in this way, but I have never known that you actually could fly in this way. It\u2019s an incredible sight and we agree on that. We are very surprised. So, later on I\u2019m also in the park, but now it\u2019s evening, as it is dark.

David Boyle and I are lying prone in what appears to be a lake. Actually the water is only a few inches deep. He has some sort of explosive charges but no matches with which to light them. I become serious and tell him to keep his voice down and find the matches. At the same time I am aware that something is out of place. The water is not deep. Suddenly we are charged from our right flank. A group of ten or fifteen men with fixed bayonets sallies towards us. They appear to be Oriental, though at the last moment I see that it is all a sham. These are our own men. I have been the object of a great joke. Rolling on the ground, David and I howl with laughter. We begin to sing a popular song. Our harmony and rhythm are surprisingly good.",

Much of the landscape resembles Ivy Hill, where I grew up. I kill some people (a black man) with a burst from my 16. Then I wish to escape and make my way to a train that goes from Vietnam to Thailand. I get out but do not want to be caught for desertion. A fellow checks my I.D. He comes upon four stamps that I have in my wallet. They have been given to me by my mother. He asks why I still carry them. I offer him one, leaving me three. I return to Vietnam and the sense of danger is heightened. It is the sense of death and destruction that haunts me more so than a confrontation with VC or NVA. Then a friend and I decide to escape by car. He drives and I am aware how wide he is taking the turns. He does not really have an idea of where he is going.

    "dream": "1. \u201cDon\u2019t Be Afraid\u201d I have just arrived to Prague in Czechoslovakia and I\u2019m together with another person \u2013 I think it\u2019s a woman. And we are on our way in a car to the hotel. The road is rather winding and hilly and we are driving over bridges. Under the bridges, there are rivers with a rather strong current. Somewhere in the distance I can see cars that are driving on roads where there is water \u2013 there is water on the roads. There seems to have been some flooding from the river. It scares me a little but I soon forget it. Then we come to a kind of tunnel with water in it. Here we have to put off the motor and set the car in a neutral gear and close doors and windows. And then the river takes us and the car away with the current. And at a certain time, the wheels in the car are turning upside down. For me it\u2019s both scary and exciting. Then we come out of the water tunnel again and the car is now driving in a normal way. We are now on a very, very big open square. The earth is some base color flax with small round spots. It could be some kind of marble. We are very excited and in high spirits and very relieved after this trip in the water tunnel and we are eating some food with a very happy feeling. The food seems to be some celery or corn or salad or things like that. While we are eating, we are looking out on this big square. The sun is shining now. Until now I have been with this other person but I never see the person in the dream. I just have a feeling it\u2019s a woman. Now I\u2019m alone at the hotel where there seems to be some problems with my room. After some time, a lady comes and takes me to room 35. This room seems to be a kind of gymnastic room with some wall hangings on the walls. Now some people try to make this room nice to stay in. They put in some shelves and some commercial stuff from a hairdresser/salon room. But now I tell this lady who showed me the room and now she is about forty and small and a little fat. I tell her that I really wouldn\u2019t like to stay in that room. One of the reasons is that there are no windows. She tells me that she thought it was room number 34 I should have and not 35. Now I go down to the reception and I have some kind of a power struggle with a man at the reception. I tell him that I want another room. He tells me that I can\u2019t have that \u2013 they don\u2019t have other rooms. But I stick to my view and after some time I tell him that if he doesn\u2019t give me another room with windows, I will write a letter to the Danish government when I come home and tell how I have been treated. Now he becomes insecure and he looks as if he\u2019s starting to cry. He says, \u201cjust a moment,\u201d and then he walks into another room. Soon after he comes back and he gives me some keys to the room 68. I think it\u2019s number 98 because in the dream, 98 seems to be the opposite of 68, but of course if you take the 6-8 and you turn it around it\u2019s 8-6, so it\u2019s 86. But never mind I have another room and everything is okay. In the dream I\u2019m very surprised that I can find my way around at the hotel because in real life I\u2019m really bad at that \u2013 I very easily get lost in streets and hotels and things like that. So, but in the dream it\u2019s okay. Now I\u2019m walking in Prague together with the lady from the hotel - the one who showed me the room 35 \u2013 and another lady I know, a former neighbor, a woman. We walk around in the town where there are no cars. The houses are beautiful white with blue turquoise ornaments and there are street entertainers who are dancing in a long row, holding each other\u2019s hands and their faces are turned towards us. The lady from the hotel tells me that it has something to do with a newly built museum. I say that these street entertainers, I would really like to show them to my son. In the background we can see some spears and we can hear some gorillas \u2013 some sounds from the churches. And then suddenly we are walking on a gravel road (I think it is like the roads you have in mountains) and in these mountains there are a lot of heather - red violet blooming heather. I say that it\u2019s fantastic that you can find this kind of gravel roads (I think it\u2019s called) in a big city. While we are walking on this gravel roads in the mountain there are some geese running after us - like when I was a child and went through a farm on my way to school there was always some geese that ran after me and I was quite afraid of them at that time. Now in the dream I start running but I\u2019m just a little afraid. Now we come to the end of the mountain where the mountain stops. The view is beautiful. You can see a lot of hills and mountains all covered with heather, this red violet color. The people I\u2019m together with walk to the edge of our mountain and look down. I look down too, but it\u2019s a sort of precipice, I think it is - they are far down and suddenly you just look down, so I get scared and I have to lie down in the heather. I don\u2019t want to show the other people that I am afraid. On some other hills and mountains you can see people are having fun tumbling down these slopes and they are really having fun. But, I\u2019m just lying in the heather and looking at it and I\u2019m not showing that I\u2019m actually afraid. The slope or precipice - there where the mountain ends and you look down is different at the mountain I\u2019m at because it sort of goes out and then it goes in and so if you fall down here you don\u2019t tumble down, you just fall down. And the other mountains I\u2019m looking at it, there you can sort of roll down or fall down, not suddenly but smoothly. [at home]",

The friendly position is in front of me. I kill one fellow (VC). The other fellow manages to break free and begins talking into a small radio. He seems to be an FO [Forward Observer]. He talks quickly, as if sensing he is to die soon. We grapple and he manages to stab me a few times. Then he too is dead. Just as this happens, something amazing occurs. The whole countryside goes up in fire. A gigantic conflagration, in twenty seconds hundreds and hundreds of yards of land are on fire. For a few moments I don't know if I've done something good or bad. All I know is that to survive I must jump into the water. It seems that I am right near the ocean. I swim forward, trying to beat the land which is also racing forward. Then, at one point, there seems a sort of monster or demon that chases me. It too is on fire but submerged underwater. From behind me a friendly force fires a weapon and kills the monster. At once all the other fire in the dream ceases. Then the dream becomes vague. I seem to be greeted by friends, friendly voices. I am facing East in the dream-the sappers are facing East. I myself seem to be out on a mission, away from a main base. The sappers come from behind; the friendly forces are in front (the same position fired on above). I am saved when the monster dies and I seem to have made contact again with friendly forces.

It could be silk. Blood was dripping from the ceiling and I got a little anxious about that and got hold of a guy who was director in the company where I work and he\u2019s a very factual guy. So I showed him the ceiling, and he said it\u2019s okay there is dripping blood down from the ceiling. And then I started looking down into another room or perhaps another world. The atmosphere was something with planets being created and destroyed, and there were earthquakes, landslips, floods, very big forces. There were fire, water and enormous power. Suddenly I saw that it was my father who was dissolving or disintegrating. I showed this to my husband, Bruce. And then I\u2019m at some kind of a theatre where somebody is very keen on making some kind of play or musical. The musical or the play should be some people some groups in turquoise and white clothes and sort of looking a bit like a carnival and they should be dancing and hopping around. I find this extremely artificial and superficial, but somehow I feel I have to be a part of it as it could have unpleasant consequences for other people if I don\u2019t want to join this happening, or whatever it is. It\u2019s very unpleasant for me, as I find the theatre and the play very empty \u2013 it\u2019s a delusion, I feel. When the play is over, we get some raisins and something they called stardust. And now my husband Bruce and I are walking along a road where there is a lot of weekend traffic. I walk behind Bruce and I\u2019m leaning on him and crying. I say that I don\u2019t want to be a part of this theatre or I don\u2019t want to use this stardust. I don\u2019t want to be a part of something that\u2019s not real here on Earth.

I\u2019m together with a very unusual wonderful handsome clever girl. She\u2019s about 11-12 years old. But sometimes she\u2019s younger because I\u2019m carrying her in my arms in some parts of the dreams. Everybody, all people in the whole world, agree that this girl is a very special child filled with love, calm and warmth. Everybody thinks that her wonderful soul or whatever you would call it, her essence, has to do with the fact that her mother was blindfolded. In the dream, this English word, \u201cblindfolded\u201d comes up. The mother lives at a big farm, a farm that Bruce and I visited at some time. I can see the kitchen very clearly and I remember precisely how it looked at the farm and how the atmosphere was. There was a lot of room, but it was all a bit dark, perhaps a bit lonesome, too. I see the contour of the mother. She looks like the women, the farmer wives, I knew as a child. I\u2019m trying to convince the John Wayne guy that he should open the school and let people come in \u2013 the people come up to the school \u2013 because the school is on a hill as it was in real life. Then you can see a lot of people standing on a road. The John Wayne guy that has no guns or other means to keep people out, he\u2019s sort of keeping them out with his stubbornness. He is rather stubborn and he doesn\u2019t speak much, again like the John Wayne in the film. I love this guy very much, but it\u2019s not an erotic atmosphere. My feelings for this man are deeper than being in love. It\u2019s more like between children and parents, or between siblings. The connection is, it\u2019s just there. Suddenly people start to walk up the hill where the school is. They are in party dress and they are coming with presents and they bring flowers, too. The first guy who comes is a psychiatrist I know. He\u2019s very, very elegant dressed black and white with a hat and a red rose in his jacket. He has a big smile, but he\u2019s rather shy. I\u2019m leaning on the John Wayne guy and I feel very, very happy. For a very long time I can see the girl\u2019s face before me - she\u2019s slim, she\u2019s dark haired and she has warm brown eyes.

I showed it to Mom along with the bags of seed and declared that I had no use for them, that they were a useless waist of my space. Mom tried to make me see that I really would need that stuff someday, saying that they would help me to become a better organist. I said that was totally wacko, that music and agriculture had no plausible relationship in my mind. She said that ground-up seed and grain were now a cheaper way for people to build pipes and relay apparatus.

Soldiers have paired off in rows, they are separated one from the next pair by ten or fifteen meters. The distance between two soldiers is twenty or thirty meters. Armed soldiers advance against their unarmed partner. I am not paired up, but caught up in the fray and in immediate danger of being shot. Recollection becomes unclear at this point.

I am now with other people watching what is taking place. The rioters jump onto an electric building scaffold and zoom up to the top of the building, maybe ten storys. The police follow and enter the building. Immediately, one girl jumps from the top story. We watch as she plummets down. I turn away at the last moment as she hits the pavement. When I look back, her head, likely split open, is covered by a sheet. A woman next to her is wailing. The body moves. She is still alive. She is moaning. I go inside the building with someone else.

But anyway, I had this dream that Elizabeth and a few other people and I wanted, we were in this bank, and she had to cash a check, and we were bored waiting for this lady to finish doing her thing. And we convinced them to give us an elevator key so that we could get on it. We got on it and we said, \u201cI wonder what\u2019s up on the tenth floor?\u201d So we went up to the tenth floor, and this elevator had a blue interior, and we got out \u2013 or we didn\u2019t get out \u2013 it was this very dark, closed-in room with light-up stained glass murals on the walls. One was like a map of the world with red continents, another was like something really abstract. So we decided, \u201cNah, let\u2019s not stay up here. Let\u2019s go down to the below-ground level and see what\u2019s down there.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOh gosh.\u201d I hung onto the railing in the elevator as we descended, almost like a bullet, we hit bottom, and the door opened, and I was expecting it to be as dark as anything, but it was a banquet, luncheon hall and there were people having their lunch in there. And Andrea stepped out of the elevator and was going to go spy on them. But then I was up last night, and I had a dream that her and I were with some other people, and oh, she came by to say sorry that she hadn\u2019t called me any more, and she wanted to go through a box of jump with me. There were like a box of broken eggs and empty cans and there was a ball and things like that. there was this two-channel mixer that apparently I had gotten for Christmas, and I just ditched when the current one came along but it was in the bedroom, and it could play ___?____ and the bedroom one could only play __?__ which was not true in real life. And so I\u2019m constantly switching back and forth between the two, and then we started going through this stuff. And I thought I saw the CD at the bottom of the box; I thought it was the one that I had been wanting, but it wasn\u2019t. It was just some blah CD. And then she and her family and I were at the beach and we were diving in this cave, and they were saying, \u201cOh, look at this, oh, look at that.\u201d And it was pitch dark, and so I was feeling around and there were these like huge tarantula things swimming in the water and big sharks with scaly fins. And I was running out of air in my breath, so I had to get out. And I had to take my clothes off for some reason, and then run past everybody and ___run_ in the bathroom so that I could put the clothes on.

I called my boss to let him know I wasn't coming in, he sounded as if he didn't believe me, this made me feel very uneasy. So much so that I almost thought it had really happened when I woke up. I also remember a moment in the dream where I showed my mother my new tattoos. When she saw them she said \"oh those are REALLY cool, I really like those.\" Now that should have been a SURE SIGN I was dreaming because those words would never part from her lips about my tattoos, which she still knows nothing about. Well she doesn't know about my new ones. Then suddenly I was with the daughter of a neighbor of my moms. The neighbor, Marie, is someone that lived down the street from us all my life. She is a wonderful lady and just recently found out she had cancer and has undergone radiation. She should be fine. Anyway I was with her daughter and we went over to her mom's house (down the street from my mom). I saw her, she looked ill, I gave her a nice hug.

A survivor of the squad, dressed in civilian clothes, relates the news in simple terms, almost cheerful, as though he were familiar with death in manner I am not. Still, I am overcome with emotion; less guilt than a sense of the impossible loss of irreplaceable men at the height of their youth. I wake up feeling very sad and speak words I cannot now recall.",

I speak to the male doll and the female doll and feel happy. I have made two friends. Then we are outside in a country at war. The terrain is hilly and partially wooded. Helicopters appear and fire rockets which explode in a suppressed manner. There is no full and dense explosion. Instead, on impact the force of the blast shoots out to the left and right. This happens several times. We begin running. A fighter plane appears overhead. I expect it to strafe us. Unexpectedly, it pulls up from a power dive and on the upswing drops a cloud of white powder or gas, which we run from. We are spotted or captured by police.",

However the date took place in the NOW as if we had known each other the whole time, very strange. I just remember meeting up with him and then hanging out, nothing significant sticks out. There was more before that moment but I can't remember it. Then I had a dream, after waking up and going back to sleep, that I was ONCE AGAIN at my mom's house. I was sleeping in my old room. I remember this baby alligator was under my bed. For some reason I was scared of it, but then the fear left. At that point I didn't realize I was at my mom's. When I left my room I went down stairs and my mom and dad were there. They were separated/divorced when I was 13 but they were together in the dream. I told them about the alligator and then came to the realization that this was their house, so they had to deal with catching this alligator, instead of me, I was relieved. I remember joking about it saying \"Well I'm glad I didn't find it in my house.\" That's about all I remember.",

I was very upset and agitated over this because there were all of these other kids in the class that really could care less about acting and if anyone should be taken out of the class to clean it should be one of them. So I left in frustration to throw some box away. Of course before leaving she told me where to throw it out, I however, wasn't listening too well and forgot what she said. So I went back and this time she came with me and showed me. Along the way I expressed my frustration about the whole situation. She seemed to agree yet she was the one who sent me in the first place... Finally we reached our destination, some lounge area of the school, and she told me to drop the box there, then I woke up.",

We were talking and then i looked down and noticed that i had not shaved my legs. Oh the horror... lol I couldn't have that so i left to go home in order to change. As i was leaving an old lady (the ticket taker) was standing there, i asked if i would be able to come back, she said yes as long as i had my ticket stub. I had it in my hand and was walking back to the car and suddenly couldn't find the stub, realized i had dropped it. I picked it up, got in my car and couldn't find the stub again, had dropped it again. Finally put it in my pocket. I also found it strange that there were only about 20 cars in the parking lot at a full concert. upon leaving the lot i see a sign that says \"Alexandria\" (thats where i live) with an arrow pointing which way to go. Turns out i was right around the corner from my house. I went in to change and then came back out to my covered car port (i dont have a covered car port). Next to my car was one of my dad's old '57 chevrolet convertibles. There were 3 people in the garage that were going to go with me (i dont know who they were) they all started climbing in my dad's car, then i told them we were taking mine. i realized my car was full of crap and boxes so we had to squeeze in, as i go to sit down i sat on something, but wasn't sure what. after some investigation i realized some moron had sat in my seat and i was sitting on his lap, i told him to get in the back. then i woke up.",

The impact must not have been too close to us because we all lived. scene change i was at my apartment and there was this dining room set in my dining room. for some reason it stood out to me, i remember thinking that someone had left it there and was going to be coming back to get it. i also remember being in the bathroom and trimming my hair, i had started with the top and sides and then something happened which prevented me from finishing. when i looked in the mirror i had a fucking mullet, you know short on the top and sides long in the back. god help me... so i went thru the rest of this dream with a mullet. Final scene involved the police. They were trying to find something, all i know is it involved someone i knew and i was withholding information that i was not going to devulge, what that info was, i have no idea.",

At one point i look over to my friend and it looks like she has died. He starts calling her name and she didn't respond, he had a really evil grin on this face. Then we did the dresser drawers thing again but this time there were objects i recognized as things i own (in real life). When going thru one drawer i saw a pearl necklace that i own and pocketed it so he wouldn't steal it. I saw my gold necklace lying there and gave it to him in hopes he would like it and leave, no such luck. At this point i just wanted to get the fuck out. I remember us getting into a scuffle.

They screamed to each other, firing their AK's wildly. I knelt and wept at the slaughter. Afterwards, we scavenged the bodies for souvenirs and did not bury the corpses. Mike Wilson put a live frag with a smoke grenade fuse under the bodies. We moved out. Fifteen or twenty minutes later we heard the grenade explode; other NY A had been killed by the booby trap. 1 am in a familiar house but cannot name it. My brother and I are young. He throws a heavy silver ring at me. I go to chase him but he hides and disappears. I go to a bedroom and look under the bed, but there is only a rumpled blanket. Then to the bathroom, where I see him through the frosted windows. My brother says, \"I guess 1 should come out.\" I agree, and confront him with the ring, which I have found. \"If you ever treat me with disrespect again I'll kill you,\" I tell him sternly. I am boiling with anger. Next, we are out in the open in a desert-like setting. My brother questions if I mean what I have said. I am on edge and angry and seek an excuse to be violent. My brother says, \"You wouldn't shoot me.\" I tell him to be quiet, not to test me. My brother continues, so I shoot him point blank in the skull. My brother falls down dead.

BUT the bad part was that i had put MY CAR in the trunk of my mom's car, yes you heard right, as if it would fit. so he calls down to the auction place and they had already sold it and CLAIM they didn't know my car was in the trunk. so i am freaking out, and then i realized i could just report the car stolen. that's all i remember.",

I wash it off in a large pool of fresh clear water. The dog swims in the water. She is happy, though somewhat nervous and high-strung, as was her nature. We continue walking and arrive at a wealthy residential area. It is safe and quiet and there is much greenery. I wear blue jeans and walk with much confidence. The dog, as was her way, romps and sprints ahead. We arrive at a store which is closed. The dog jumps up on a small landing. I pet her and she places her arm on mine and nuzzles me. There is a profoundly strong and shared sense of happiness and well-being. In fact, the sense of love is the deepest I have felt in a long, long time. Then a young married couple oogle and awe and pet the dog and the spell is broken. We continue walking and it is good, but the intense feeling of love is lost.",

    "dream": "first lucid dream! yeah! do you know what a lucid dream is? basically it's becoming aware you are dreaming, while dreaming, and then staying in the dream. (many people immediately wake up out of excitement when this first happens). a few months ago i became lucid and woke up immediately so i didn't really count that one. but the other night i was having a dream, in my dream a friend named darryl showed up. i woke up (or so i thought i think i was still dreaming) and i told myself \"if darryl appears again you will know your dreaming\". i fell back to sleep and someone else, named jerome, showed up in my dream. even though it wasn't darryl i immediately realized i was dreaming. then i thought \"what can i do\" so i decided to grab jerome and start kissing him, go figure. when you are in a lucid dream it is much different. as you know most dreams almost appear as if you are watching them, where when lucid you are actually there, consciously aware of what is going on and you \"sometimes\" have the ability to create and or do whatever comes to mind, although it stays very dream like in many aspects, as far as things constantly changing and not making sense... anyway i woke up about 1 minute later, but remembered the lucid part quite vividly. if you are interested in finding out more about lucid dreaming check out http://www.lucidity.com.",

I am high up in a tree with two small children. Opposite us we watch a mother bird feed her young. She flees at the approach of a giant rat. He enters the nest and scavenges for food. He slithers down, the dead body of an animal hanging from his mouth. The rat then begins climbing up the tree. The children are frightened. My plan is to let it crawl up to our height, then punch the glass collar though which it must pass to reach us. When the rat\u2019s head is beneath the glass I begin punching. I disregard the possible damage to my fist. The glass breaks, blood streams down the tree from the rat\u2019s smashed head. The rat falls away and dies.",
